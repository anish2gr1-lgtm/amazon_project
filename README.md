## Amazon USA Sales Analysis

## Difficulty level: Advanced

---
Project Overview
I have worked on analysing a dataset of over 20,000 sales record from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of
customer behaviour, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue
analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management. 

This project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationship between tables.
